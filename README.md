##Subscribe plugin
It turns out, sending an email to a group of subscribers is actually quite a hairy problem. One would 
think storing a set of emails, looping over each one of them and sending out emails is all that needs to be done.
But this solution only works for a very small subscriber base(5-10 max). 
Any more, and you could be invoking the wrath of the email Gods - your emails could be classified as spam 
or worse, your domain could potentially be flagged as a spammer!
(Tag v1.0 of this project uses the naive approach.. Feel free to take a look if you are interested).

The solution is to use the services of a third-party provider like [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/) 
that specializes in safe email transmission, and handles all the myriad requirements of bulk mailing.

This OctoberCMS plugin allows you to easily add a "Subscribe" button on your website. These subscribers get
 added to a "list" on Mailchimp.
The plugin also hooks into Rainlab Blog events, and allows subscribers to receive emails 
when a blog gets published (via Mailchimp Campaigns - Each blog publish event results in the creation of a campaign)
